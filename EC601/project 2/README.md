## Folder Structure
### static folder
This folder is used to store the javascript(.js) files to provide functions to web pages.
**searchLocation.js**: is designed for handling location search functionality. It involves creating a new geocoder object from the Google Maps API, getting the value entered in an address input field, and managing markers and information windows on a map. It is used to allow users to search for specific locations on the map.
**openAI.js**: is designed for retrieving user input and sending it to the backend program to get a response from OpenAI's APIs, and then displays it.
**navigate.js**: is designed for navigation. It includes functions about process the users' location input and get a route between two locations. Also, it can process the location information that the users selected on the map and get detailed information about the location.

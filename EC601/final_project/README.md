![Poster](./images/Poster.png)

## Introduction
The project is to build the a software platform for object detection in 3D point cloud data. It leverages OpenMMLab's MMDetection3D toolbox to process point cloud data, implement the detection model, train/test the model, etc. With an intuitive GUI, it allows users easier utilize advanced algorithms for 3D Object detection from point cloud data, providing a efficient way for a wide range of applications in fields like robotics, autonomous vehicles, an so on.

### Major Features
+ **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: An intuitive GUI, designed in Python PyQt5, facilitating seamless interaction with the software's functionalities. The GUI includes Login windows, detecting, training and testing tabs.  
+ **Sign up/in Module**: Provides registration and login window to ensure authorized access to the software.  
+ **Detecting Module**: Provides pretrained models on point cloud datasets. Users can upload the point cloud data and visualize the detection results.  
+ **Training Module**: Enables users to train their own detection model with selected datasets.  
+ **Testing Module**: Enables users to test trained models on selected datasets, offering insights into model performance and accuracy.
